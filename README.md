# What is EFG T7 MONOLOGUE????

EFG T7 is a game modification for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 based on boiii.  
The Steam version of Black Ops 3 is required to be owned and installed for BOIII to work (Or you can use a cracked version of bo3 with the latest version but we do not recommend it). You can get it from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/311210/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_III/">here</a>.
